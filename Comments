DORM ISSUES/STUDENT LEADERSHIP PROGRAM
Dorm student leaders are very corrupt and the interview process is Extremely biased. Most "TOP 6" student leaders are not interested in what the dorm wants or needs, Most focus on their own personal wants and needs. Lots of student leaders do not know how to separate professional relationships from their personal relationships and often dole out more punishment to people that dont like and fail to hold their friends, Themselves and other leaders accountable. These issues seem to persist even through a change of leadership. The training available to leaders and those who have the desire to become a student leader are lacking to say the least. These trainingings fail to teach the proper knowledge and skills to effectively lead and ultimately fails those who are interested in obtaining those skills.. 

CENTER WIDE ISSUES 
I and many others have noticed racial and age bias along with lack of consistency in the enforcement of the center's Zero Tolerance Policy. The center often sends certain students home and retains others for the same offenses based on what seems like a bias in favor of students of color and or younger age.

TABE 
The Test Of Adult Basic Education is absolutely useless and wastes the time of students and instructors. The TABE math Requirement is far out of reach for the majority of students and shouldn't be required if a student is pursuing a HISET or Highschool Diploma
